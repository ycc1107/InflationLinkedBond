The theory part:
Pricing inflation linked bond is similar like pricing regular bond with extra inflation adjustment. The formulas for pricing inflation linked bond are as follow:
Bond Price=〖RefCPI〗_maturityDay/〖RefCPI〗_issuedDay ×PV(Par Value)+∑▒〖[PV((coupon rate)/100×day/year)×Par Value)〗×RefCPI/〖RefCPI〗_issuedDay   ]
〖RefCPI〗_j=〖CPI〗_j+(t-1)/D×(〖CPI〗_(j+1)-〖CPI〗_j)
〖Index Ratio〗_j=〖RefCPI〗_j/〖RefCPI〗_(issuedDay  ) 

For each coupon payment and principal payment, the total amount should multiple index ratio which base on CPI on payment day and CPI on issue day. Beside the adjustment of index ratio, the inflation index bond is same as regular bond.  
The code part:
The inputs should include: 
	Settlement days
	National 
	Pricing date
	Issue date
	Maturity date
	Next payment date
	Coupon rate
	CPI growth rate
	Payment frequency 
	Zero coupon bond yield curve
	CPI historical data 
Code flow:
	Construct zero coupon bond yield curve or use existing one
	Calculate refCPI for each payment day
	Calculate CPI adjusted present value of accrued interest 
	Calculate CPI adjusted sum of present value of coupon payments without accrued interest
	Calculate CPI adjusted present value of principal
	Add 4 and 5 to calculate clean price
	Output clean price and accrued interest

The basic theory is following the paper “pricing methodology for inflation linked bond and inflation linked buy/sell-backs” and other reference are “calculation examples for inflation-linked bonds”, “calculation convention for inflation linked bond” 


In the quantlib, it uses bootstrap to forecast the cpi index.
